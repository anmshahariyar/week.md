## Cloud Backup Options

### (a) Adequacy and Sufficiency of Current Backup Arrangement

**Current Backup Arrangement**: The corporate office uses a local RAID NAS to back up corporate data, including sales, financial, customer, and staff data, as well as automated regular backups of key computers in the network.

**Evaluation**:
- **Redundancy**: RAID configurations provide data redundancy, ensuring that data is not lost due to individual drive failures.
- **Speed**: Local backups are generally faster since they do not rely on internet bandwidth.
- **Control**: The company has full control over its backup hardware and data storage location.

**Advantages**:
1. **Data Redundancy**: RAID configurations such as RAID 1 (mirroring) or RAID 5 (striping with parity) ensure data integrity even if one drive fails.
2. **Speed and Accessibility**: Local backups can be performed and restored quickly, as they do not depend on internet speeds.
3. **Control and Security**: Complete control over the backup process and physical security of the data.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Single Point of Failure**: The NAS device itself can become a single point of failure. If the NAS is damaged (e.g., fire, flood, or theft), all backups could be lost.
2. **Limited Scalability**: Expanding storage capacity requires additional hardware, which can be costly and logistically challenging.
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Local backups do not protect against site-wide disasters. If the entire office is compromised, the backups stored on the NAS would also be at risk.

**Conclusion**: While the local RAID NAS provides redundancy, speed, and control, it has significant limitations in terms of disaster recovery and scalability. To improve the backup strategy, integrating cloud and non-cloud options should be considered.

### (b) Cloud Backup Options

**Potential Cloud Backup Solutions**:

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3**:
   - **Specifications**:
     - **Storage Capacity**: 1 TB
     - **Region**: Australia
     - **Annual Cost**: Approximately 463.21 AUD
   - **Advantages**: Highly durable storage, scalability, ease of access, integration with other AWS services, and automated data replication across multiple locations.
   - **Disadvantages**: Ongoing costs, potential latency in data retrieval, and dependency on internet connectivity.

2. **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage**:
   - **Specifications**:
     - **Storage Capacity**: 1 TB
     - **Region**: Australia
     - **Annual Cost**: Approximately 397.98 AUD
   - **Advantages**: Integration with Azure services, automated data replication, high durability, and availability.
   - **Disadvantages**: Ongoing costs, potential latency in data retrieval, and dependency on internet connectivity.

**Recommendation**: Azure Blob Storage is recommended for its lower cost while still providing high durability and integration capabilities.

### (c) Non-Cloud Backup Options

**Potential Non-Cloud Backup Solutions**:

1. **Offsite Tape Storage**:
   - **Description**: Backups are stored on magnetic tapes and transported to an offsite location.
   - **Advantages**: Long-term storage, high capacity, and physical separation from the primary site.
   - **Disadvantages**: Manual handling, slower data retrieval, and potential for tape degradation over time.

2. **Additional NAS Device (Offsite)**:
   - **Description**: A second NAS device is placed at a different physical location.
   - **Advantages**: Automated backups, fast data retrieval, and control over data storage.
   - **Disadvantages**: Higher upfront cost, ongoing maintenance, and potential for the same disaster affecting both sites if not far enough apart.

**Recommendation**: An additional NAS device at an offsite location is recommended for its ease of integration with the current setup and faster data retrieval compared to tape storage.

## Ethical Issues

### 4.4.1 Identify Issues with Data Collection

The franchise registers and collects information about their member-clients. This data collection raises several ethical and social issues:

**Privacy Concerns**:
- **Issue**: Collecting personal data such as health information, contact details, and workout plans can lead to privacy concerns.
- **Recommendation**: Implement clear data privacy policies, obtain explicit consent from members, and ensure transparency about what data is collected and how it is used.

**Data Minimization**:
- **Issue**: Collecting more data than necessary can lead to potential misuse and increased risk of data breaches.
- **Recommendation**: Collect only the data necessary for operational purposes. Avoid collecting excessive information and regularly review the data collection process to ensure it aligns with the principle of data minimization.

**Data Security**:
- **Issue**: Storing sensitive personal data requires robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Recommendation**: Implement strong encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to protect collected data. Ensure that both the corporate office and franchise outlets follow these security measures.

**Data Access and Use**:
- **Issue**: Allowing franchisees to access member-client information can lead to misuse or unauthorized sharing of data.
- **Recommendation**: Restrict data access to authorized personnel only and implement role-based access controls. Regularly monitor and audit data access to prevent misuse.

**Compliance with Regulations**:
- **Issue**: Data collection and use must comply with local and international data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that data collection practices comply with relevant laws and regulations. Regularly update policies and practices to remain compliant with evolving regulations.

**Ethical Use of Data**:
- **Issue**: Using collected data for marketing purposes without clear consent can lead to ethical concerns.
- **Recommendation**: Obtain explicit consent from members before using their data for marketing. Clearly communicate the purpose of data collection and provide options to opt-out of marketing communications.

### 4.4.2 Identify Issues with Security Cameras

The installation of security cameras in the main office, gym, and retail shop raises several ethical and social concerns:

**Privacy Invasion**:
- **Issue**: Security cameras can be perceived as an invasion of privacy, especially in sensitive areas such as change rooms or restrooms.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure cameras are installed only in public and high-security areas. Avoid placing cameras in areas where privacy is expected, such as changing rooms and restrooms.

**Surveillance and Trust**:
- **Issue**: Extensive surveillance can create a sense of mistrust among employees and members.
- **Recommendation**: Clearly communicate the purpose of the cameras and ensure they are used solely for security purposes. Balance the need for security with respect for individual privacy.

**Retention and Access to Footage**:
- **Issue**: How long the footage is retained and who has access to it can raise concerns.
- **Recommendation**: Define clear policies for the retention and access of recorded footage. Limit access to authorized personnel only and ensure that footage is stored securely.

**Compliance with Local Laws**:
- **Issue**: The use of security cameras must comply with local laws and regulations governing surveillance and data protection.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that the installation and use of security cameras comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Regularly review and update practices to remain compliant.

**Transparency and Consent**:
- **Issue**: Lack of transparency about the presence of cameras can lead to ethical issues.
- **Recommendation**: Inform employees and members about the presence of cameras through clear signage. Obtain consent where required and provide a privacy policy that explains how the footage will be used.
